# charge4fleets-non-fixed-routes
This demo was used in an interview with Nassau County. It demonstrated how Charge4Fleets could leverage isochrones to evaluate range of vehicles by the number and type of trips that were expected. This is not meant to be a detailed approach, but a visual for operators to see the limits for duty cycle considerations.
